```

**Important Note:**
- This endpoint expects the **final value** for the goal progress, not incremental values. Any additions to the previous progress must be calculated in the front-end before sending the request.
- If the `current_value` reaches or exceeds the `target_value`, the goal status will automatically be set to "COMPLETED" and a notification will be created.
- When restarting a goal, the `current_value` will be reset to 0 and the `start_date` will be updated to the current time.

### Check Inactive Goals

#### `GET /api/goals/check-inactive/`

Checks for and marks goals that have been inactive for more than 7 days. A goal is considered inactive if it hasn't been updated in the last 7 days.

**Response (200 OK)**
```json
{
  "message": "3 goals marked as inactive"
}
```

**Notes:**
- For each inactive goal, the status will be changed to "INACTIVE".
- A notification will be created for each inactive goal to remind the user.
- This endpoint is typically used for periodic checks, such as via a cron job or scheduled task, but can also be triggered manually.

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request body or parameters |

## Additional Notes

1. Both users and their mentors/coaches can view the user's goals.
2. Only the user who created a goal or is assigned as a mentor can retrieve, update, or delete that goal.
3. The progress update endpoint is designed for the goal owner only.
4. Automatic notifications are generated for:
   - New goals assigned by coaches
   - Completed goals
   - Goals that become inactive
5. All timestamps are in UTC format.
