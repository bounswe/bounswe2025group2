# Overall Description

The platform is designed to connect young individuals with local sports programs to promote an active lifestyle and combat harmful habits. By offering a comprehensive directory of sports activities, the platform allows users to find free and low-cost programs based on their location and age group. In addition, the platform encourages fitness progress through virtual challenges, personalized fitness goals, and the opportunity to connect with experienced mentors and coaches for guidance. Users can earn rewards, share their progress with the community, and engage in forums dedicated to training tips, motivation, and success stories.

This platform aims to provide a safe, engaging, and motivating environment where young individuals can develop a healthy relationship with fitness while being supported by a community of mentors, coaches, and peers. It also empowers users to track their achievements, interact with others, and participate in fitness challenges that promote personal growth.

The project will utilize a robust tech stack to ensure seamless performance and scalability across web and mobile platforms. For the back-end, Django REST Framework (Python) and Spring Boot (Java) will be used to build efficient and secure APIs, while MySQL and PostgreSQL databases store user data and progress information. On the front-end, React 18+ and Vue.js will be used for the web application, ensuring responsive and dynamic user interfaces. The mobile app is going to be built with React Native, allowing cross-platform compatibility for both iOS and Android. _Please note that the tech stack are subject to change._
