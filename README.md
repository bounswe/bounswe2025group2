## Docker Compose Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
2. Ensure you have Python virtual environment set up and activated:
```bash
python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate
   
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Database Configuration

Make sure your settings.py has the following database configuration:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_DB', 'group2db'),
        'USER': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_USER', 'group2'),
        'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_PASSWORD', 'group2'),
        'HOST': 'postgres', # This should match the service name in docker-compose.yml
        'PORT': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_PORT', '5432'),
    }
}
```

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Start all services (database, backend, and frontend):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

2. Start services in detached mode (background):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Start all services with build:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. View logs of running containers:
```bash
docker-compose logs
```

5. Stop all services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

6. Stop all services and remove volumes (this will delete all data):
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Important Notes
- The database service (PostgreSQL) runs on port 5432
- The backend service runs on port 8000
- The frontend service runs on port 3000
- Database data is persisted in a Docker volume named postgres_data
- The backend service will automatically run migrations and populate initial data
