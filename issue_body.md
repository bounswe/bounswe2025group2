## Issue Description
We need to implement a thread bookmarking feature for our forum. This will allow users to save threads they are interested in and easily access them later. The backend needs to be updated to support storing these bookmarks for each user, and the frontend needs to be updated to allow users to interact with this feature.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create `ThreadBookmark` model in backend
- [ ] Implement API endpoint to bookmark a thread
- [ ] Implement API endpoint to remove a bookmark
- [ ] Implement API endpoint to list user's bookmarked threads
- [ ] Update frontend to show bookmark button
- [ ] Create frontend page/view to list bookmarked threads

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A user can successfully bookmark a thread.
- [ ] A user can successfully remove a bookmark from a thread.
- [ ] The system prevents duplicate bookmarks for the same thread by the same user.
- [ ] A user can retrieve a list of all their bookmarked threads.
