### Running the Django server
0. Make sure you have configured and using the External PostgreSQL database as described below.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

2. Create a virtual environment if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
     
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. cd into the `genfit_django` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend/genfit_django
   ```

6. Make migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```
   
7. Migrate the database:
   ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
   
8. Create a superuser (optional):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

9. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   

### Setting up the database

0. Make sure you have Docker installed and running.

1. Make sure you are in the `genfit_django` directory.

2. Make sure you have the `.env` file set up with the correct database settings. You can copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and modify it as needed.

3. In order to build the database, use the postgres-db docker file
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f postgres-db.yml up -d
   ```

4. In order to stop the database, use the postgres-db docker file
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f postgres-db.yml down
   ```

**Note**: After configuring the database for the first time, you can run the following command to create the database and tables:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
You should see the default tables created in the database.
   
**Note**: Database is supposed to persistent, so you can stop and start the database without losing data. However, running this command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```
will remove the database volume and all data will be lost. Use this command with caution.



### Common Errors

- If the `settings.py` uses a custom Postgres database and the database is not running, you might see an error like this:
```
  django.db.utils.OperationalError: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: Connection refused
        Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed: Connection refused
        Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
```
This means that the database is not running as expected. Make sure to run the database using Docker as described above.
