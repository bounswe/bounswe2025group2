## What Gets Created

The scripts create forums with the following data:

1. **Fitness Tips & Advice**
   - Description: Share your fitness tips, workout routines, and get advice from the community.

2. **Nutrition & Diet**
   - Description: Discuss healthy eating habits, meal planning, supplements, and nutrition strategies.

3. **Workout Routines**
   - Description: Share and discover effective workout routines for different fitness goals.

## Requirements

- Django environment must be set up
- Database must be accessible
- UserWithType model must have at least one admin user (script will create one if none exists)

## Notes

- Scripts check for existing forums to avoid duplicates
- An admin user will be created automatically if none exists
- All forums are created as active by default
- Forums are ordered sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure you're in the correct directory
2. Ensure Django is properly set up
3. Check that the database is accessible
4. Verify that the api app is properly installed

## Output

The scripts will show:
- ‚úÖ Success messages for created forums
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning messages for existing forums
- üéâ Final success message with count
