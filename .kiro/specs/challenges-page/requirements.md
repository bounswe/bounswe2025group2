# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Challenges page is a comprehensive feature that enables users to participate in fitness challenges and allows coaches to create and manage challenges. This feature will provide a social and competitive aspect to the GenFit application, encouraging user engagement and motivation through community-driven fitness goals.

The page should integrate seamlessly with the existing application architecture, following the same design patterns as the Goals page while providing unique functionality for challenge management, participation, and progress tracking.

This implementation addresses the official system requirements 1.2.4.1 through 1.2.4.9 for Challenges and Leaderboards functionality.

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE EXISTING BACKEND APIs** - The backend challenge API endpoints are already fully implemented and must be used exactly as documented. Do not create new endpoints or modify existing ones.
